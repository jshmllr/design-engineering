# Resources (Curated Map)

This is a curated, opinionated map of resources used throughout the learning path. The goal is not to read everything—it's to **use references to ship artifacts**.

## Role framing (what design engineering is)

- Vercel: Design Engineering at Vercel  
  `https://vercel.com/blog/design-engineering-at-vercel`
- Adobe: Should you pursue a career in design engineering?  
  `https://adobe.design/stories/leading-design/should-you-pursue-a-career-in-design-engineering`
- Design Engineer (definition)  
  `https://www.designengineer.xyz/design-engineering`
- Jim Nielsen: The case for design engineers  
  `https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/the-case-for-design-engineers/`
- Marcel: Becoming a design engineer  
  `https://marcel.io/posts/becoming-a-design-engineer`

Use these to answer, in your own words:

- What do you build?
- What’s your quality bar?
- Where do you sit in the product team?
- What differentiates you from “frontend engineer” and “product designer”?

## Reference systems (how great teams define quality)

- Vercel design guidelines (structure, language, components, patterns)  
  `https://vercel.com/design/guidelines`

Study guidelines like a codebase:

- Identify recurring tokens (type, spacing, color, radii)
- Extract patterns (layout rules, density, motion)
- Note decision principles (when to use what)

## Web platform ground truth

- MDN (the canonical reference)  
  `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/`

Suggested MDN focus areas:

- HTML semantics and forms
- CSS layout, selectors, cascade
- Accessibility fundamentals
- Web APIs for UI (events, observers, animations)

## CSS craft and practical patterns

- CSS-Tricks  
  `https://css-tricks.com/`
- Josh W. Comeau (CSS mastery and UI craft)  
  `https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/`

Use these for:

- layout recipes
- motion patterns
- “why does this look off?” debugging
- building intuition for UI polish

## Tools overview (choose intentionally)

- Design Engineer tools index  
  `https://www.designengineer.xyz/tools`

Rather than collecting tools, document your own stack:

- Design: Figma (and how you use it)
- Code: framework + styling approach
- Docs: Storybook or MDX docs
- Quality: a11y/perf checks you actually run

## Jobs and role discovery

- Design engineering roles board  
  `https://designengineer.io`

Use job posts to back-solve your portfolio:

- Extract recurring skills
- Convert each into a project artifact (demo + write-up + measurable outcomes)
