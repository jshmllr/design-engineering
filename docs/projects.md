# Projects (Portfolio-Grade)

Each project is designed to produce **application-ready artifacts**:

- **Demo** (deployed or runnable)
- **Code** (clean structure, README, docs)
- **Case study** (what/why/how + tradeoffs)
- **Quality proof** (a11y + performance notes)

Use `templates/case-study.md` and `templates/project-readme.md` for every project.

## How to pick projects (align to real roles)

Browse postings on `https://designengineer.io` and choose projects that demonstrate:

- UI craft (polish, motion, responsive behavior)
- Design systems thinking (tokens, components, guidelines)
- Collaboration readiness (docs, constraints, handoff)
- Web fundamentals (semantic HTML/CSS/JS)
- Quality (accessibility + performance)

## Project menu

### 1) Component Gallery + Design Tokens (the “baseline portfolio”)

**Goal**: Build a small UI kit with tokens and 8–12 components.

Deliverables:

- Tokens: color, spacing, radii, type scale
- Components: Button, Input, Select, Checkbox, Tabs, Badge, Toast, Modal, Tooltip, Card, Table
- Docs: usage guidelines, do/don’t, accessibility notes, content guidance

What this proves:

- System thinking + UI consistency
- API design for components
- Documentation quality

### 2) Rebuild a guideline page (reverse-engineer quality)

**Goal**: Rebuild one page/pattern inspired by a high-quality guideline system.

Reference:

- `https://vercel.com/design/guidelines`

Deliverables:

- A rebuilt page/pattern
- Notes on what you noticed (type rhythm, spacing, states, motion)
- A “rules extracted” section (tokens + principles)

What this proves:

- Visual attention to detail
- Ability to learn from real systems and translate into code

### 3) Accessibility-first component: Dialog / Menu / Combobox

**Goal**: Build one notoriously tricky interactive component with a strong a11y story.

Deliverables:

- Keyboard interaction map
- Focus management approach
- ARIA rationale (what you used and why)
- Manual test script (screen reader optional but great)

What this proves:

- Professional UI engineering skills
- Ability to ship inclusive interactions

### 4) Motion study: UI micro-interactions + reduced motion

**Goal**: Create a small collection of motion patterns that improve perceived quality.

Deliverables:

- 6–10 motion snippets (hover/press, enter/exit, loading)
- Easing/duration guidelines you follow
- Reduced-motion behavior

What this proves:

- Taste + restraint in motion
- Awareness of accessibility and platform constraints

### 5) Performance debugging: make a UI faster (and prove it)

**Goal**: Create a deliberately slow UI (or take an existing one), then profile and improve it.

Deliverables:

- Before/after measurements (what you measured and how)
- A list of changes with rationale
- A “what I’d do next” section

What this proves:

- Debugging skill and rigor
- Understanding of rendering costs and tradeoffs

### 6) Theming + contrast: build a token-driven theme system

**Goal**: Implement theming (light/dark + brand variants) with accessible contrast rules.

Deliverables:

- Token strategy (semantic vs. raw palette tokens)
- Contrast checks (manual notes are okay)
- Component examples across themes

What this proves:

- Design + engineering alignment
- Practical accessibility thinking

### 7) “From Figma to code” mini case study

**Goal**: Take a small Figma design (or your own) and implement it with high fidelity.

Deliverables:

- Constraints and assumptions
- Component breakdown
- Implementation notes (layout decisions, type scale, spacing)
- QA checklist results

What this proves:

- Handoff fluency
- High-fidelity implementation skill

## Recruiter/Hiring manager scan checklist (ship this with your repo)

- Clear “Start here”
- 2–4 polished demos (even small ones)
- Readable, scoped case studies (why + tradeoffs)
- Evidence of quality: a11y, perf, responsiveness
- A consistent voice: your principles, not just links
