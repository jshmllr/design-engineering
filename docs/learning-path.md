# 30-Day Learning Path

This is a focused 30-day path to build design engineering fundamentals. It follows a weekly cadence and expects you to produce tangible artifacts each week.

## Week 1 — Foundations
**Focus:** What design engineering is, how it works in teams, and expected deliverables.

- Read foundational definitions and role framing.
- Map collaboration touchpoints across design, engineering, and product.
- Capture core deliverables and a skills gap analysis.

Start here: `docs/weeks/week-1-foundations.md`

## Week 2 — Interaction & prototyping
**Focus:** Interaction design, UI craft, and state-driven components.

- Recreate a real UI component with motion and states.
- Add progressive enhancement for reduced motion.
- Publish a short write-up with screenshots.

Start here: `docs/weeks/week-2-interaction.md`

## Week 3 — Systems, accessibility, and performance
**Focus:** Reusability, accessibility, and quality bars.

- Systemize a component with variants.
- Add accessibility and theming considerations.
- Write a mini case study on performance tradeoffs.

Start here: `docs/weeks/week-3-systems.md`

## Week 4 — Product thinking & storytelling
**Focus:** Product framing, shipping, and narrative.

- Define a user problem and build a small feature concept.
- Document constraints, tradeoffs, and outcomes.
- Consolidate artifacts and finalize your 30-day recap.
