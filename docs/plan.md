# 30-Day Design Engineering Plan

Use this tracker to keep pace with the 30-day learning path. Each week builds toward a portfolio-ready understanding of design engineering fundamentals.

## How to use this tracker
- Check off items as you complete them.
- Add links to your notes, prototypes, or write-ups.
- Revisit gaps weekly and note next steps.

## Week 1: Foundations — Role, scope, and mindset
**Goal:** Define design engineering, understand team collaboration, and map expected deliverables.

- [ ] Day 1 — Read the foundational definitions and origins. Draft a 1–2 paragraph definition of design engineering.
- [ ] Day 2 — Map where design engineering sits in a product team (design, engineering, product).
- [ ] Day 3 — List 6–8 core deliverables (prototypes, UI tooling, component systems, etc.).
- [ ] Day 4 — Identify key attributes and behaviors. Write a short skills gap analysis.
- [ ] Day 5 — Summarize “what design engineering is and isn’t.”

Artifacts:
- Notes:
- Definition draft:
- Team map:

## Week 2: Interaction & prototyping
**Goal:** Build small interaction-driven prototypes and document tradeoffs.

- [ ] Day 6 — Choose a UI component to recreate. Focus on states and motion.
- [ ] Day 7 — Implement interaction polish (hover, focus, transitions).
- [ ] Day 8 — Add progressive enhancement (prefers-reduced-motion).
- [ ] Day 9 — Document design + engineering decisions (constraints, tradeoffs).
- [ ] Day 10 — Publish a short write-up with screenshots/gifs.

Artifacts:
- Prototype link:
- Write-up:

## Week 3: Systems, accessibility, and performance
**Goal:** Transform components into reusable system pieces and evaluate tradeoffs.

- [ ] Day 11 — Refactor a component for reusability (tokens, variants).
- [ ] Day 12 — Add accessibility considerations (ARIA, keyboard, contrast).
- [ ] Day 13 — Add theming support or responsive behavior.
- [ ] Day 14 — Profile or reason about performance tradeoffs.
- [ ] Day 15 — Create a mini case study.

- System component:
- Case study:

## Week 4: Product thinking & storytelling
**Goal:** Ship a small feature concept and communicate outcomes.

- [ ] Day 16 — Define a user problem + interaction concept.
- [ ] Day 17 — Build the interactive prototype (core flow).
- [ ] Day 18 — Refine UI + motion.
- [ ] Day 19 — Document UX goals + constraints.
- [ ] Day 20 — Ship and publish the feature case study.
- [ ] Day 21 — Portfolio recap and reflection.
- [ ] Day 22 — Optional: record a walkthrough demo.
- [ ] Day 23–30 — Consolidate work, update README, and outline next learning steps.

- Feature prototype:
