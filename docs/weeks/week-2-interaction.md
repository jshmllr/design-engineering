# Week 2: Interaction & prototyping

## Objectives
- Build interaction-focused UI prototypes.
- Practice communication of UX intent and technical decisions.

## Daily plan
**Day 6 — Choose a component**
- Pick a real product UI component to recreate (button group, modal, nav, etc.).
- Define states (default, hover, focus, disabled) and motion intent.

**Day 7 — Implement interaction polish**
- Add transitions and responsive behavior.
- Validate behavior across different screen sizes.

**Day 8 — Progressive enhancement**
- Add prefers-reduced-motion handling.
- Provide a reduced-motion fallback.

**Day 9 — Document decisions**
- Write a short rationale about tradeoffs, constraints, and implementation choices.

**Day 10 — Publish a write-up**
- Compile screenshots/gifs and publish a short write-up.

## Outputs
- Prototype demo
- Interaction notes
- Short write-up
