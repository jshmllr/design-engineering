# Design Engineering — Start Here

This repository is a **self-learning guide to design engineering**: the craft of building product UI with both **design quality** (layout, type, motion, accessibility) and **engineering quality** (maintainability, performance, systems thinking).

If you’re new, start with:

- **Learning path**: `docs/learning-path.md`
- **Resources (curated)**: `docs/resources.md`
- **Exercises (daily/weekly drills)**: `docs/exercises.md`
- **Projects (portfolio-grade)**: `docs/projects.md`
- **Glossary**: `docs/glossary.md`

## How to use this repo

- **Pick a pace**:
  - **4-week sprint**: focus on 1–2 projects + targeted drills.
  - **8–12 week path**: complete the full learning path + 3–5 projects.
- **Keep a log**: copy `templates/study-log.md` into your own notes folder (or use Issues/Discussions).
- **Build artifacts**: for every topic, aim to produce something tangible:
  - a component, a demo, a write-up, a performance/a11y audit, or a mini guideline.

## What “good” looks like (north star)

- **UI craft**: intentional spacing, type scale, color, states, motion, and responsive behavior.
- **System thinking**: reusable components, tokens, constraints, and clear guidelines.
- **Web fundamentals**: semantic HTML, modern CSS, and practical JavaScript.
- **Quality**: accessibility, performance, and resilience across devices/browsers.
