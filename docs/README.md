# Design Engineering — 30-Day Learning Plan

This repository is a **self-guided 30-day plan** to learn design engineering fundamentals. It’s structured to help you understand the role, build small prototypes, and document decisions like a practicing design engineer.

## Start here
- **30-day overview**: `docs/learning-path.md`
- **Progress tracker**: `docs/plan.md`
- **Week-by-week guides**:
  - Week 1 — Foundations: `docs/weeks/week-1-foundations.md`
  - Week 2 — Interaction & prototyping: `docs/weeks/week-2-interaction.md`
  - Week 3 — Systems, accessibility, and performance: `docs/weeks/week-3-systems.md`
  - Week 4 — Product thinking & storytelling: `docs/weeks/week-4-product.md`
- **Sources (all references)**: `docs/sources.md`

## How to use this repo
- **Fork it**, then clone your fork.
- **Follow the weekly guides** and track progress in `docs/plan.md`.
- **Create artifacts** as you go: small prototypes, write-ups, diagrams, or case studies.
- **Publish your work** (GitHub Pages, Vercel, or screenshots in the repo).

## What you’ll learn
- **Role clarity**: what design engineering is and isn’t.
- **Collaboration**: how to work with design, engineering, and product teams.
- **Deliverables**: prototypes, UI tooling, system components, and documentation.
- **Hybrid skills**: UI craft + front-end engineering fundamentals.

## Success criteria
By day 30, you should have:
- A written definition of design engineering in your own words.
- 2–4 prototypes or mini case studies.
- A documented perspective on tradeoffs, constraints, and implementation details.
